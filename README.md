 # Project 3 with General Assembly: MERN web app.
 ## Intro
A 10 day project with three other team members, where we planned, designed and built a CRUD app using MERN stack.
My contributions in this project were the Index page and Navbar coding and styling, and copy on front and index pages. The back-end was team-coded.

 ### Tools used: 
 * MongoDB & Mongoose
 * Express
 * ReactJS 
 * Bootstrap
 * Node.js
 * Git & GitHub
 
 
Our team loves teas and coffees, and to celebrate our course cohort and our diverse backgrounds, we built a service to introduce and celebrate different types and preparation methods of teas and coffees from around the world.
