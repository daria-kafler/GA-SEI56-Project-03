Project: “Heiss Drinks” [ readme | live ]
A 10 day project with three other team members, where we planned, designed and built a web app with CRUD functionality, and two custom APIs.
My contributions in this project were the Index page and Navbar coding and styling, and copy on front and index pages. The back-end was team-coded.

Our team loves teas and coffees, and to celebrate our course cohort and our diverse backgrounds, we built a service to introduce and celebrate different types and preparation methods of teas and coffees from around the world.
